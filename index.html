				<h2>What's the big deal?</h2>

				<p>Writing is a pretty big deal. It's how we communicate our ideas to the world around us--and also receive what others are trying to communicate <em>to</em> us. Without written language, we would be completely reliant on oral communication, and while the latter has its uses and value, there is nothing quite like the beauty of written language.<br>
					
				<br>Hence, it's a mystery as to why writing is still so poorly taught to us over the course of our academic lives. Writing and written language can so wonderfully illuminate the very essence of our humanity--our ability to reason, to ask and provide answers to the most fundamental question that has fueled our species' progress: "why".<br>
					
				<br>And yet.<br>
					
				<br>Writing is often presented to us from a young age as a painfully dry subject, riddled with rules and terms that lack a <em>meaningful context.</em> As such, these rules seem to exist solely to bore us to tears. Just think of your grade school grammar lessons. We're taught to memorize conjunctions ("Remember your FANBOYS, class!"), identify indirect object pronouns, pronoun antecdents, and countless other parts of speech--not to mention all the punctuation marks--without really being shown what it all amounts to. The big picture. In other words, our teachers were at fault for making writing so damn <em>boring</em>; for failing to inspire and instill in us an appreciation for the <a href="awesome.html" class="text_links">stuff that <em>really</em> makes written language awesome.</a><br>
					
				<br>So what is that, you ask? Well of course, grammar and syntax and punctuation and the mechanics of writing are all very important and crucial to our literary success. Trying to proceed without a strong foundation in these things would be like trying to skip ahead to calculus without knowing your multiplication or division. It just wouldn't work. However, a writing teacher should not merely mandate that his or her students memorize a bunch of rules and regulations then take quizzes on the material. Rather, a great writing teacher will <em>contextualize</em> all these very dry things by observing them alongside inspiring examples wherein which they may be found. We might call this <a href="examples.html" class="text_links">"other people's good writing".</a><br>
					
				<br>In sum, we are creatures of context; we crave it. This is how we make sense of the world. And how we learn to write is no different. We must <em>see</em> a masterful use of literary irony in order to truly understand what it is, much the same way it would be helpful to dissect, as a class, a particularly well-written sentence plucked from our vast literary cannon in learning to recognize modifiers, prepoisitional phrases, and the imperative mood. This, you can see, would be much more valuable than memorizing their definitions.<br>

				<br>The art of writing thus necessarily begins with changing the way we were taught to think about writing. First off, what writing most certainly isn't is a bunch of dry rules. On the contrary, in order to write well, we must first see how other successful writers have "written well", and use their examples as <em>context</em> in which we may place the various rules we are aiming to learn to utilize. Then we must practice. And while there is no telling how much practice one needs in order to become a great writer, there is some comfort to be had in knowing that sticking to this process of contextualizing (i.e reading) and practicing (i.e writing)--over and over again--will most definitely yield a <em>better</em> writer.
