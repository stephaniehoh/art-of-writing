				<h2>The Stuff That Makes Writing Awesome</h2>

				<h3>What Really Makes Your Writing <em>Sing</em></h3>
				<p>Written language, i.e writing, is certainly inextricable from the oral tradition. If you think about it, writing--though it may exist on a page in silent, unspeaking form--<em>is</em> ultimately heard. It's just that instead of hearing it out loud, we "hear" it in our heads. That's why it's appropriate, though perhaps counterintuitive, to compare writing to another form of art that is consumed and appreciated aurally: music.<br>

				<br>Indeed, great writing possesses many of the standard elements of great music--rhythm, tasteful repetition (in writing, this comes in the form of alliteration and motifs), phrasing, and dynamics. All of these things, when present in writing, are palpable to our ears because we "hear" what we read to ourselves in our heads. Given this fact, the question still remains: how do I add and manipulate rhythm, phrasing, and dynamics in my own writing? The long of it is that there are countless combinations of the aforementioned elements available to us. A good starting point, however, is understanding the basic components that make up <strong>rhythm and phrasing</strong>. We'll get to dynamics afterwards.<br>
				</p>

				<h4>Rhythm and Phrasing</h3>
				<p>The easiest way to explain <strong>rhythm</strong> is that you can control it by <em>alternating the lengths and syllables of your words, per sentence</em>. In other words, each sentence should contain some alternating combination of longer words followed by some shorter words, and so on and so forth. As mentioned above, we "hear" writing in our heads, so much like music, writing too needs to take advantage of rhythmic diversity--and one way we can achieve this is by making sure we mix some words that "sound" long with some words that "sound" short. Your ear will intuitively appreciate this, because it will naturally hear the interesting patterns in the <em>rhythm</em> of your writing (as opposed to tuning out the monotony induced by sentences constructed with only long words or mostly short words). Similarly, you can manipulate <strong>phrasing</strong> by <em>alternating the lengths of your sentences, one after another</em>. The logic here follows that which drives rhythm, meaning our ears like to hear some diversity not only within each sentence, but also from sentence to sentence. Thus, writing comprised mostly of long sentences, one after the other, will likely put you to sleep; writing comprised mostly of short sentences might sound underdevloped, "childish," and equally off-putting. Conversely, the best and most engaging writing will possess some combination of long, short, shorter, medium, and longer sentences. If you're having trouble believing any of this, just listen to the oral version of one of the greatest speeches ever written (yes, speeches are usually <em>written</em> first).<br> 

				<br>
				One of the greatest oratory deliveries of all time, Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech is the paradigm of great rhythm and phrasing. Pay close attention and you will hear how masterfully he manipulates both, alternating between longer phrases that build in both momentum and energy and shorter phrases that bring you back down. The most famous of these short phrases repeated throughout the speech, of course, is the mono-syllabic motif: <strong>"I have a dream."</strong>
